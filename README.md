This is a web application which is an online real-time code editor to improve pair
programming.It is web-based application that allows multiple users to
simultaneously view and edit code files over a distributed environment.We
developed the features for a seamless editing experience among the users.

C/C++, Java etc. It can help users to code in different languages at the same time
and at the same place.

To use this website , users directly interact with the website and without any

Different groups of users can create different rooms having different roomId.
